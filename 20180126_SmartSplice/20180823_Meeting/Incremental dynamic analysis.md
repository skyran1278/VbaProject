# Incremental dynamic analysis

## SUMMARY

- 總結了各篇會講甚麼，不重要

1. INTRODUCTION

    - 隨著電腦越來越快，分析的方法就越加複雜。
    - 線性靜力、動力 => 非線性靜力 => 非線性動力
    - the range of response or ‘demands’ versus the range of potential levels of a ground motion record
    - the structural implications of rarer/more severe ground motion levels
    - the changes in the nature of the structural response as the intensity of ground motion increases (e.g. changes in peak deformation patterns with height, onset of sti4ness and strength degradation and their patterns and magnitudes)
    - estimates of the dynamic capacity of the global structural system
    - a multi-record IDA study, understanding how stable (or variable) all these items are from one ground motion record to another
